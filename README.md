# Prediction of Asteroids that are potentially hazardous to our Earth.  
In Astronomy, the size of data is increasing day by day 
and is becoming more complex than in previous years. It is 
even also found in the study of asteroids. There are millions 
of asteroids to study their classification and calculate its 
diameter to determine their characteristics. This will help us 
to know which are potentially hazardous asteroids for Earth.
# Dataset   
The dataset is taken from kaggle made by NASA JPL officially.It contains the asteroids' various orbital parameters such as eccentricity,semi major axis,perihelion distance,inclination and 
Earth minimum orbit intersection distance.   
# Prerequisites   
Python data preprocessing libraries such as:   
Numpy   
pandas   
and machine Learning library Scikit-Learn.
